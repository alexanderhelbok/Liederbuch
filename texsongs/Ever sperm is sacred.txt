Every Sperm is sacred
Dad:
There are Jews in the world, there are Bud-
dhists. There are Hindus and Mormons and
then, there are those that follow Mohammed,
but – I’ve never been one of them!
I’m a Roman Catholic, and have been since
before I was born, and the one thing they say
about Catholics is, they’ll take you as soon as
you’re warm.
You don’t have to be a six-footer, you don’t have
to have a great brain, you don’t have to have any
clothes on – You’re a Catholic the moment Dad
came. Because:
Single child: Let the heathen spill theirs on the
dusty ground, God shall make them pay for each
sperm that can’t be found.
Children: Every sperm is wanted,
every sperm is good. Every sperm is needed
in your neighborhood.
Mum: Hindu, Taoist, Mormon spill theirs just
anywhere, but God loves those who treat their
semen with more care.
Neighbours etc.: Every sperm ... Every sperm is
sacred, every sperm is good. Every sperm is nee-
ded in your neighborhood. Every sperm is useful,
every sperm is fine. God needs everybody’s. Mine!
And mine! And mine!
Dad (Ref.):
Every sperm is sacred, every sperm is great. If a
sperm is wasted, God gets quite irate.
Children:
Every sperm ...
Nun: Let the Pagan spill theirs o’er mountain,
hill and plain. God shall strike them down for
each sper that’s spilt in vain.
Everybody: Every sperm is sacred, every sperm
is good. Every sperm is needed in your neighbor-
hood. Every sperm...
