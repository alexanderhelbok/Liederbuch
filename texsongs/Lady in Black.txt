Lady in Black
She Em came to me one morning,
one lonely Sunday morning,
her D long hair flowing in the
Em mid-winter wind.
I Em know not how she found me,
for in darkness I was walking,
and D destruction lay around me
from a Em fight I could not win.
Em Ahahaaa D aahah, Em ahahaaa D aha Em a!

She Em asked me name my foe then.
I said the need within some men
to D fight and kill their brothers
without Em thought of men or god.
And I Em begged her give me horses
to trample down my enemies,
so D eager was my passion
to Em devour this waste of life.
Em Ahahaaa D aahah, Em ahahaaa D aha Em ah!

But Em she would not think of battle
that reduces men to animals,
so D easy to begin and yet Em impossible to end.
For Em she the mother of all men
had counciled me so wisely that
I D feared to walk alone again
and Em asked if she would stay.
Em Ahahaaa D aahah, Em ahahaaa D aha Em ah!

»Oh Em lady lend your hand,« I cried,
»Oh let me rest here at your side.«
»Have D faith and trust in me,« she said
and Em filled my heart with life.
There is no strength in numbers.
I’ve no such misconceptions.
But D when you need me be assured
I Em won’t be far away.
Em Ahahaaa D aahah, Em ahahaaa D aha Em ah!
