American Pie
1. A G long D long Em7 time ago
Am I can still re-C -member
how that Em music used to make me D smile.
And G I knew D if I Em7 had my chance
that Am I could make those C people dance and
Em maybe they’d be C happy for a D while.
But Em February Am made me shiver
Em with every paper Am I’d deliver
C Bad news G on the Am doorstep
I C couldn’t take one D more step
I G can’t re-D -member if I Em cried when I
Am7 read about his D widowed bride
But G something D touched me Em deep inside
the C day the D7 music G died (C-G) D

Refr:
G Bye C bye Miss A- G-merican D Pie.
Drove my G chevy to the C levy
but the G levy was D dry
And them G good old C boys
were drinking G whiskey and D rye
Singin’ Em this’ll be the day that I A7 die
Em this’ll be the day that I D7 die.
2. G Did you write the Am book of love and
do C you have faith in Am God above?
Em If the Bible D tells you so.
Do G you be-D -lieve in Em Rock ’n Roll?
Can Am7 music save your C mortal soul?
And Em can you teach me
A7 how to dance D real slow?
Well, I Em know that you’re in D love with him
’cause I Em saw you dancin’ D in the gym
You C both kicked G off your A7 shoes.
Man, I C dig those rhythm’n D7 blues
I was a G lonely D teenage Em broncin’ buck
with a Am pink carnation and a C pickup truck.
But G I knew D I was Em out of luck the C day
the D7 music G died C
G I started D singin’ + Ref.
3. G Now for ten years we’ve been Am on our own
and C moss grows fat on a Am rollin’ stone
Em But that’s not how it D used to be.
When the G jester D sang
for the Em King and Queen
In a Am7 coat he borrowed C from James Dean
and a Em voice that came from A7 you and D me
Oh, and Em while the King was D looking down
the Em jester stole his D thorny crown
The C courtroom G was ad-A7-journed,
no Cverdict was reD7turned
And while G Lenin D read a Em book of Marx
the Am court kept practice C in the park
And G we sang D dirges Em in the dark the C day
the D7 music G died. C
G We were D singing + Ref.
4. G Helter-Skelter in a Am summer swelter
the C Byrds flew off with a Am fallout shelter
Em Eight Miles High and D falling fast,
it G landed D foul out Em on the grass
The Am7 players tried C for a forward pass but
the Em jester’s on the A7 sidelines in a D cast
Now the Em half-time air was D sweet perfume
while the Em sergeants played
a D marching tune
C We all G got up to A7 dance
but we C never got D7 the chance
’cause the G players D tried to Em take the field.
The Am marching band re-C-fused to yield
G Do you D recall Em what was revealed
the C day the D7 music G died? C
G We started D singing + Ref.
5. G Oh, and there we were all Am in one place,
a C generation Am Lost in Space
Em With no time left to D start again
So come on, G Jack be nimble Em Jack be quick
Jack Am7 Flash sat on a C candlestick ’cause
Em fire is the A7 Devil’s only D friend
Oh, and Em as I watched him D on the stage
my Em hands were clenched in D fists of rage
C No angel G born in A7 hell,
could C break that Satan’s D7 spell
And as the G flames climbed D high in-
Em-to the night to Am light the sacri-C-fical rite
I saw G Satan D laughing Em with delight,
the C day the D7 music G died C
G He was D singing + Ref.
6. I G met a D girl who Em sang the Blues
and I Am asked her for some C happy news
But Em she just smiled and turned D away
I G went down D to the Em sacred store
Where Am7 I heard the music
C years before
but the Em man there
said the C music wouldn’t D play
And in the Em streets
the Am children screamed the Em lovers cried,
and the Am poets dreamed
But C not a G word was Am spoken
the C Church bells all were D broken
And the G three men D I ad-Em -mire most,
the C Father, Son and the D7 Holy Ghost
They G caught the D last train Em for the coast,
the C day the D7 music G died. C
And G they were D singing + Ref.
