\title{Fernando} 

\begin{enumerate}
\myverse{ \acc{C} Can you hear the drums, Fernando? \\ 
I remember long ago \\ 
another starry night like \acc{Am} this. \\ 
In the firelight Fer-\acc{Dm}-nando, \\ 
you were humming to yourself \\ 
and softly strumming your gui-\acc{G}-tar. \\ 
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of \\ 
bugle calls were coming from the \acc{C} far. }

\myrefrain[]{Refrain:}{ There was something in the \acc{G7} air that night, \\ 
the stars were bright, Fer-\acc{C}-nando. \\ 
They were shining there for \acc{G7} you and me, \\ 
for liberty, Fer-\acc{C}-nando. \\ 
Though we \acc{A} never thought that we could lose \\ 
there’s no re-\acc{D}-gret. \\ 
\acc{D7} If I had to do the \acc{G} same again, \\ 
I \acc{G7} would my friend Fern-\acc{C}-ando. }

\myverse{ They were closer now, Fernando. \\ 
Ey’ry hour, ev’ry minute \\ 
seemed to last eternal-\acc{Am}-ly. \\ 
I was so afraid, Fer-\acc{Dm}-nando, \\ 
we were young and full of life \\ 
and none of us prepared to \acc{G} die. \\ 
And I’m not ashamed to say the roar of guns \\ 
and cannons almost made me \acc{C} cry. \Reff }

\myverse{ Now we’re old and grey, Fernando, \\ 
and since many years \\ 
I haven’t seen a rifle in your \acc{Am} hand. \\ 
Can you hear the drums, Fer-\acc{Dm}-nando? \\ 
Do you still recall the frightful night \\ 
we crossed the Rio \acc{G} Grande? \\ 
I can see it in your eyes how proud you were \\ 
to fight for freedom in this \acc{C} land. \Reff }
