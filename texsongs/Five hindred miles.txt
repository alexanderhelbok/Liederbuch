one hundred G miles, one hundred Em miles,
one hundred Am miles, one hundred C miles,
you can Am hear the whistle D blow
one hundred G miles.
2. Lord I’m G one, Lord I’m Em two,

Lord I’m Am five hundred C miles
away from D home, D7
five hundred G miles, five hundred Em miles,
five hundred Am miles, five hundred C miles,
Lord I’m Am five hundred D miles
away from G home.
3. Not a G shirt on my Em back,

Lord I Am can’t go a-C-lone thissa D way, D7
Thissa G way, thissa Em way,
Thissa Am way, thissa C way,
Lord I Am can’t go a-D-lone thissa G way.
