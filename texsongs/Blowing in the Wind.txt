Blowing in the Wind
1. C How many F roads must a C man walk Am
down, C before you F call him a C man G7?
C How many F seas must a C white dove Am sail,
C before she F sleeps in the G7 sand?
Yes and C how many F times must the
C cannon balls Am fly, C before they’re F forever
G banned G7?
Refrain:
The F answer my G7 friend
is C blowing in the Am wind
The F answer is G7 blowing in the C wind
2. C How many F years can a C mountain Am exist,
C before it is F washed to the C sea G7?
Yes and C how many F years must some C
people Am exist, C before they’re F allowed to
be G7 free?
Yes and C how many F times can a C man
turn his Am head, C pretending that he F just
doesn’t G see G7? + Ref.

3. Yes and C how many F times must a C man
look Am up, C before he can F see the C sky G7?
Yes and C how many F ears must C one man Am
have, C before he can F hear people G7 cry?
Yes and C how many F deaths will it C take till
he Am knows, C that too many F people have G
died G7? + Ref.
