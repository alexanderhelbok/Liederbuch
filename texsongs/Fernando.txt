Fernando
1. C Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember long ago
another starry night like Am this.
In the firelight Fer-Dm-nando,
you were humming to yourself
and softly strumming your gui-G -tar.
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of
bugle calls were coming from the C far.
Refrain:
There was something in the G7 air that night,
the stars were bright, Fer-C-nando.
They were shining there for G7 you and me,
for liberty, Fer- C-nando.
Though we A never thought that we could lose
there’s no re- D -gret.
D7 If I had to do the G same again,
I G7 would my friend Fern- C-ando.
2. They were closer now, Fernando.
Ey’ry hour, ev’ry minute
seemed to last eternal-Am -ly.
I was so afraid, Fer-Dm-nando,
we were young and full of life
and none of us prepared to G die.
And I’m not ashamed to say the roar of guns
and cannons almost made me C cry. + Ref.
3. Now we’re old and grey, Fernando,
and since many years
I haven’t seen a rifle in your Am hand.
Can you hear the drums, Fer-Dm-nando?
Do you still recall the frightful night
we crossed the Rio G Grande?
I can see it in your eyes how proud you were
to fight for freedom in this C land. + Ref.
