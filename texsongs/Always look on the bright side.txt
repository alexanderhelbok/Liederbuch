Always look on the bright sight of live
Some Am things in life are D7 bad
They can G really make you Em mad
Am Other things just
D7 make you swear and G curse.Em
When you’re Am chewing on life’s D7 gristle
Don’t G grumble, give a E whistle
And A7 this’ll help things
turn out for the D best...
Refrain:
And ... G always Em look on
the Am bright D7 side of G life...Em Am D7
G Always Em look on the Am light D7 side of G life.
Em Am D7 ...
If Am life seems jolly D7 rotten
There’s G something you’ve Em forgotten
And Am that’s to laugh and D7 smile
and dance and G sing Em
When you’re Am feeling in the D7 dumps
G Don’t be silly E chumps
Just A7 purse your lips and whistle –
that’s the D thing.
Refr
For Am life is quite D7 absurd
And G death’s the final Em word
You must Am always face the D7 curtain
with a G bow Em
Forget Am about your sin D7 –
give the G audience a E grin
A7 Enjoy It’s your last chance D anyhow.
So G always Em look on the
Am bright D7 side of G death Em Am D7
G Just Em before you
Am draw your D7 terminal G breath Em Am D7
Am Life’s a piece of D7 shit
G When you look at Em it
Am Life’s a laugh and D7 death’s a joke,
it’s G true Em
Am You’ll see it’s all a D7 show
Keep ‚em G laughing as you E go
Just A7 remember that the last
laugh is on D7 you.
Refr
