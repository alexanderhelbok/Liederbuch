Donna, Donna
1. Am On a E wagon Am bound for E market,
Am there’s a Dm calf with a E mournful Am eye.
High aEbove him Am there’s a E swallow
Am winging Dm swiftly E through the Am sky.
Refrain:
G How the winds are Am laughing,
they G laugh with all their C might,
G laugh and laugh the C whole day Am through,
and E half the summer’s Am night.
E Donna, donna, donna, Am donna,
G donna, donna, donna, C don.
E Donna, donna, donna, Am donna,
donna, donna, E donna, Am don.
2. Am »Stop comEplainin’«, Am said the E farmer,
Am »Who told Dm you a E calf to Am be,
why don’t E you have
Am wings to E fly with
Am like the Dm swallow
so E proud and Am free?« + Ref.
3. Am Calves are E easily
Am bound and E slaughtered,
Am never Dm knowing the E reason Am why,
but who E ever Am treasures E freedom,
Am like the Dm swallow has E learned to Am fly.
+ Ref.
