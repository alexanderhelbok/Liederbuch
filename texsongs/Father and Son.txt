Father and Son
It’s not G time to make a D change,
just reC lax, take it Am7 easy,
you’re still G young, that’s your Em fault,
there’s so Am much you have to D know.
Find a G girl, settle D down,
if you C want you can Am7 marry,
look at G me I am Em old but I’m Am happy. D
I was G once like you are D now,
and I C know that it’s not Am7 easy
to be G calm, when you’ve Em found
something going Am on. D
But take your G time, think a D lot,
think of C everything you’ve Am7 got
for you will G still be here Em tomorrow,
but your D dreams may not.G
How can G I try to exDplain,
when I C do he turns aAm7 way again,
it’s G always been the Em same, same old Am
story. D

From the G moment I could D talk,
I was C ordered to Am7 listen,
now there’s a G way and I Em know, that I D have
to G go away.
I D know, I C have to G go.
It’s not G time to make a D change,
just sit C down, take it Am7 slowly,
you’re still G young, that’s your Em fault,
there’s so Am much you have to go D through.
Find a G girl, settle D down,
if you C want you can Am7 marry,
look at G me I am Em old but I’m Am happy. D
All the G times that I’ve D cried,
keeping C all the things I Am7 knew inside,
it’s G hard but it’s Em harder to ig-Am -nore it. D
If they were G right I’d D agree,
but it’s C them they know not Am7 me.
Now there’s a G way and I Em know that I D have
to G go away,
I D know, I C have to G go.
